        <h2>What is a scale?</h2>
<p>A scale is a way of mapping data values to new ones in order to create a visualization. A scale has input and output domains that include the range of possible input values and output values. The scale function also has the ability to convert an input or output to its respective output or input given the assigned domain.</p>
       <h2>How is the scale function used within visualizations?</h2>
        <p>Within a visualization, scale can be used when the data includes large values that would be too great to reasonably display otherwise. The scale function will allow those large numbers to be viewed on the screen with a new set value of pixels that is assigned in the output range. Another way in which scale can be used in a visualization is to display data in terms of time and date. This requires the conversion of strings to date objects followed by the use of a time scale. </p>
